coala-quickstart: personalized coala setup for your project
-----------------------------------------------------------
coala-quickstart is a tool that helps users to quickly get started
with coala. It can generate a ``.coafile`` (
`coala <https://github.com/coala/coala>`__'s configuration
file) that is tailored to your project. This supports projects in
several languages, including popular languages such as C/C++, Python,
JavaScript, CSS, Java.

Please note that you will want to manually adapt the configuration to
your needs!

=====
Usage
=====

coala-quickstart is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. To get
started, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ coala-quickstart

This should prompt you for the project directory. If you want to use the current
directory, just press the return key and you'll be on your way!

At the end, you should have a file named ``.coafile`` generated at the root of your
project directory. This contains all the settings needed by coala to lint and
fix your code.

When this is done, simply fire up coala from your project's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ coala

You can also open the ``.coafile`` in your favorite editor and edit
the settings to suit your needs. Check out our `coafile specification <http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users/coafile.html>`__
to learn more.
